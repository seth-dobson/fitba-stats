# Fitba Stats

... is an open-source analytics engineering project for fans of European football, and sports data nerds in general.

The project focuses on basic team stats (goals, shots, and shots on target), and related metrics. 

Sorry no xG.

## League coverage

Only the Scottish Premiership is included so far (I'm a Celtic fan).

I plan to add England, Spain, Italy, and Germany next.
