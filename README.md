# Fitba Stats

Open-source analytics engineering project for fans of European football and sports data nerds in general.

Focus is on basic team stats (goals, shots, and shots on target) and related metrics. Sorry no xG.

## League coverage

Only Scottish Premiership so far (I'm a Celtic fan). 21 seasons going back to 2000/01.

## Data sources

## Want to contribute?

Just fork this repo, makes changes, and submit a pull request. 

This is a great way for football fans with an interest in data analytics to develop some core data engineering skills (unix, SQL, python, git, and dbt).
