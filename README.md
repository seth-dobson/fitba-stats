# Fitba Stats

This a data engineering side project focusing on Scottish football (soccer) stats.

Fitba Stats is built using the following tools:

- Unix 
- SQL 
- python
- git
- dbt

## League coverage

Only the Scottish Premiership is included so far (I'm a Celtic fan).

However, I plan to add lower leagues in the future.

## Data source(s)

The main source of data is [football-data.co.uk](http://football-data.co.uk/).

Football-Data is a betting website that compiles match results from the BBC and shares them for free as CSV files on their website.
