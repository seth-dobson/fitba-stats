# Fitba Stats

This an analytics engineering side project focusing on European league football (soccer).

**Sorry no xG.** (That's not the point of this.)

## League coverage

Only the Scottish Premiership is included so far (I'm a Celtic fan).

However, I plan to add England, Spain, Italy, and Germany in the future.

## Data source(s)

The main source of data is [football-data.co.uk](http://football-data.co.uk/).
